### Project

The goal is to implement a website via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks.  

It uses real time data through an external API.  

The app has 5 sections :
1. Home : current portfolio's holdings, net asset values and cash position
1. Quote : gives you the latest price of a stock
1. Buy : allows users to buy a stock
1. Sell : is where you select among the stocks you own the one you'd like to sell
1. History : keeps track of all your transactions  

The homepage also allows you to buy / sell stocks you already possess, making it easier than the regular buy / sell pages.  

Feel free to leave a comment!
